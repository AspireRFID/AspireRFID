/**
 * <p>
 * The EPCIS Query Control Interface provides a general framework by which
 * client applications may query EPCIS data. The interface provides both
 * on-demand queries, in which an explicit request from a client causes a query
 * to be executed and results returned in response, and standing queries, in
 * which a client registers ongoing interest in a query and thereafter receives
 * periodic delivery of results via the EPCIS Query Callback Interface without
 * making further requests. These two modes are informally referred to as "pull"
 * and "push", respectively.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Standing queries are made by making one or more subscriptions to a previously
 * defined query using the
 * {@link subscribe(String, QueryParams, URI, SubscriptionControls, String)
 * subscribe} method. Results will be delivered periodically via the Query
 * Callback Interface to a specified destination, until the subscription is
 * canceled using the {@link #unsubscribe(String) unsubscribe} method. On-demand
 * queries are made by executing a previously defined query using the
 * {@link poll(String, QueryParams) poll} method. Each invocation of the
 * {@link poll(String, QueryParams) poll} method returns a result directly to
 * the caller. In either case, if the query is parameterized, specific settings
 * for the parameters may be provided as arguments to
 * {@link subscribe(String, QueryParams, URI, SubscriptionControls, String)
 * subscribe} or {@link poll(String, QueryParams) poll}.
 * </p>

    /**
     * Registers a subscriber for a previously defined query having the
     * specified name. The <code>params</code> argument provides the values to
     * be used for any named parameters defined by the query. The
     * <code>dest</code> parameter specifies a destination where results from
     * the query are to be delivered, via the Query Callback Interface. The
     * <code>dest</code> parameter is a URI that both identifies a specific
     * binding of the Query Callback Interface to use and specifies addressing
     * information. The <code>controls</code> parameter controls how the
     * subscription is to be processed; in particular, it specifies the
     * conditions under which the query is to be invoked (e.g., specifying a
     * periodic schedule). The <code>subscriptionID</code> is an arbitrary
     * string that is copied into every response delivered to the specified
     * destination, and otherwise not interpreted by the EPCIS service. The
     * client may use the subscriptionID to identify from which subscription a
     * given result was generated, especially when several subscriptions are
     * made to the same destination. The <code>dest</code> argument MAY be
     * null or empty, in which case results are delivered to a pre-arranged
     * destination based on the authenticated identity of the caller. If the
     * EPCIS implementation does not have a destination pre-arranged for the

     *            Specifies a destination where results from the query are to be

     *            both identifies a specific binding of the Query Callback
