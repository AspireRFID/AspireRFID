 * <p>
 * The EPCIS Query Callback Interface is the path by which an EPCIS service
 * delivers standing query results to a client.
 * <p>
 * Each time the EPCIS service executes a standing query according to a
 * <code>QuerySchedule</code>, it SHALL attempt to deliver results to the
 * subscriber by invoking one of the three methods of the Query Callback
 * Interface. If the query executed normally, the EPCIS service SHALL invoke the
 * {@link callbackResults(QueryResults) callbackResults} method. If the query
 * resulted in a <code>QueryTooLargeException</code> or
 * <code>ImplementationException</code>, the EPCIS service SHALL invoke the
 * corresponding method of the Query Callback Interface.
 * <p>
 * Note that "exceptions" in the Query Callback Interface are not exceptions in
 * the usual sense of an API exception, because they are not raised as a
 * consequence of a client invoking a method. Instead, the exception is
 * delivered to the recipient in a similar manner to a normal result, as an
 * argument to an interface method.
