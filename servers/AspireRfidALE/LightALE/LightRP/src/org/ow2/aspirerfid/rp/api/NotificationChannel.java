 * A NotificationChannel is used to report notifications to a single host. It has a list

 * host. If no DataSelector is explicitly associated, then the Readerâ€™s current
 * DataSelector SHALL be used.
 * Notification SHALL be sent whenever the associated Trigger fires. Alternatively, a
 * host MAY also query the NotificationChannel for its contents, using the
 * command NotificationChannel.readQueuedData().
