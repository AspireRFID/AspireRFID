<body>
This is the implementation of the bluetooth server. The implementation
is a while that always waits for a message from the client, processes it
and returns an answers. It can be done several times. All the messages
are in text format, the implementation does not permit binary or
specific type of date (int, char).

The message request is to process the received messages. The message
response is to create the message to send to the client.
