      title="Edit ECSpec and LRSpec">
   <description>
      After creating an EBProc in the editor, you can edit the corresponding LR Spec and EC Spec of that EBProc. Select the EBProc you want to edit in the editor, right click on it, then select Edit -&gt; EC Spec from the context menu. Then one editor should show up on the up right corner of the IDE. You can start editing everything in that editor. Notice that the EC Spec editor is able to monitor your selection in the diagram. So if you create or select another EBProc in the diagram, the EC Spec editor will also update the information to that EBProc.
