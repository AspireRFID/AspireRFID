The NFC Museum.

Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies are mature and are meeting the mass
market in many application domains. They provide the possibility to automate many
processes that had been lacking such features. Museum exhibits are one such case,
and have traditionally been static pieces that do not interact with users or provide
any additional context. In this demonstration we present an open-source middleware
for museology. Our work uses external devices such as media renderers to create an
augmented reality environment around visitors to improve interaction and the overall
experience from the exhibit, while giving museum management valuable information
about visitor behavior. The NFCMuseum middleware is part of the ASPIRE project
funded by the European Commission. Sources are available for download at the
OW2 Consortium forge.
